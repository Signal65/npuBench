        { "role": "user", "content": "Article:\nThoughts on the economic scene.If you remember only one thing about tax reform, it should be this: it’s hard.\n\nThoughts on the economic scene.\n\nAs I mentioned in an article on Sunday, the most expensive tax breaks tend to be popular. The three largest are those for employer-provided health insurance, mortgage interest and 401(k) saving. The largest corporate tax breaks include some popular ones as well, like the tax benefit for research and development.\n\nOver the weekend, Mitt Romney waded into the tax-reform debate, inadvertently, when reporters overheard him telling Republican donors which tax breaks he would consider eliminating as president. The three he named were the deduction for mortgage interest on vacation homes and the deductions for state and local taxes. Although his remarks were a bit vague, he seemed to suggest that he would eliminate them only for high-income households.\n\nHow much revenue would those steps produce? Maybe about $40 billion a year, using generous assumptions. That is hardly nothing; $40 billion is more than half the annual cost of the Bush tax cuts on income above $200,000 a year, for instance.\n\nYet $40 billion still pales compared with the size of future deficits or, for that matter, the additional tax cuts that Mr. Romney has proposed. Those cuts would cost the government more than $400 billion a year relative to current policy, according to the Tax Policy Center. Relative to current law – which includes a series of tax increases that take effect on Jan. 1 – the Romney tax cuts would cost close to $900 billion a year. To put it another way, if Mr. Romney eliminated the deductions he mentioned, he would need to come up with at least 10 times as much loophole-closing — and maybe 20 or 30 times as much — to keep his tax plan from adding to the deficit.\n\nAs for the details on the loophole-closing he mentioned: The mortgage deduction on second homes costs the federal government somewhere in the neighborhood of $10 billion a year, Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center told me. If Mr. Romney’s proposed tax cuts also became law, the cost would fall to $8 billion, because some of the additional revenue would be lost to lower marginal rates. And if the proposal applied only to affluent families with second homes, rather than all owners of second homes, the change would raise less than $8 billion.\n\nNo matter what, Mr. Williams called the estimate \"very rough\" and said the actual number could be considerably lower than $8 billion or $10 billion.\n\nEliminating the deductions for state and local taxes on top income would probably make a bigger difference. The total cost of those deductions, including for property taxes, will be $68 billion in fiscal 2013, the Office of Management and Budget says. Other analysis, by the Joint Committee on Taxation, suggests that perhaps half of this total might apply to income above $200,000 a year (a cutoff Mr. Romney has previously used to define top incomes). That would reduce the deficit by $30 billion to $40 billion a year.\n\nSo even under fairly aggressive estimates, the elimination of these three deductions would raise only a modest amount of money.\n\nMr. Romney did not claim otherwise, to be sure. The broader point is simply that tax reform is difficult. Eliminating tax breaks for the affluent, as both President Obama and Mr. Romney have proposed, can make a serious dent in the deficit, but it almost certainly cannot eliminate the long-term deficit on its own.\n\nThe long-term deficit stems from a basic disconnect between the government Americans want and the taxes they now pay. Closing that gap will probably be impossible without raising taxes on the 98 percent of Americans who make less than $200,000 a year — or cutting their benefits deeply." }

        { "role": "user", "content": "In one sentence, describe what the following article is about:\n\nGet rid of the cooking grate, set the top aside, and open the bottom vents of the grill. You want as much air as possible to get to your charcoal in order to start an even, strong burning fire. Clean out any ash now, as it will smother your fire and keep the charcoal from lighting evenly. Aim the opening of the bag into the center of the grill when dumping out the briquettes to naturally form a pyramid. Then use your hands or a pair of long-handled tongs to stack any other pieces of charcoal along the sides on the pyramid. Start with roughly half the number of briquettes outlined below to start your grill. Once it's hot, add charcoal, 5-7 piece at a time, to get the grill up to full strength.  For a small, portable grill, you want 25-30 briquettes, or pieces of charcoal, when you start cooking. For a medium to average sized grill, you'll want roughly 40 briquettes. For a large or industrial grill, you will need 1 bag or more of charcoal to cook. You don't want to drench your charcoal in the fluid, as it takes a while to burn and will make a thick, unappetizing smoke. Simply squirt the fluid for no more than a count of \"2 Mississippi\" around the center of the pyramid, trying to get the fluid in the middle.  You can also start your pyramid, douse the inner briquets with fluid, then pile the \"top\" of the pyramid above the lighter fluid soaked briquets to make sure the whole pile gets hot. A mistake that many grillers make is using too much lighter fluid, which then imparts a petroleum-like tinge to the taste of their food. You do not need a lot of fluid, just enough to get a few pieces of charcoal smoking. These pieces will then help the rest of the pile catch. Do not light the grill immediately. Waiting allows the lighter fluid to soak into the top layer of charcoal, helping it to burn evenly. Lightly squirt the pyramid with a few bursts of lighter fluid in several places, only letting it soak in for a few seconds. This is what will \"catch,\" so you don't want to drown the charcoal in fluid or you risk a dangerous flair up. You just want a few little areas of fluid to start your fire. Though lighter fluid is not made to flare up, it should still be treated with respect. Light the pile in 2-3 places where you put the lighter fluid, aiming to get the middle of the pile lit where possible. The fire will likely start large, with big flames leaping around the charcoals, but this is just the lighter fluid burning. Once the flames die down, the center of the pile should be smoking and developing white/gray coloring. This means your fire has caught. Once you can barely see any black, the fire is ready for cooking. The inner coals of your pyramid should be glowing red. Spread the coals in your desired pattern, adding more if you plan on grilling for a long time. As a general rule of thumb, you should add a handful or two of coals every 30 minutes if you plan on continuing to grill.  You want 1-2 layers of charcoal over your entire grilling area, not patches of charcoal or solitary, exposed coals. Charcoal maintains heat by staying clustered together, much like ice in a pack stays cold longer than separated cubes. If you've added charcoal, wait 5-6 minutes for them to catch. Since the heat of the rest of the charcoals is already hot enough, it should not take long. Use a clip to seal the top of the bag if you have leftovers in the bag. The additives in the charcoal will evaporate, making them harder to light next time with or without lighter fluid.\n\nSummary:" }

The 48-year-old Aussie was recently rescued by U.S. Coast Guard when he lost his way kayaking in the waters off New York's Long Island. However, it wasn't his dramatic rescue most people were talking about -- it was his dramatic weight gain. \n  \n Crowe is currently filming Darren Aronofsky's Noah, and the actor apparently needed to gain some weight for the role. This isn't the actor's first time he's packed on the pounds for a film. He gained a whopping 63 pounds for 2008's Body of Lies, completely doing away with his lean, muscular Gladiator physique. \n  \n Who else needed to gain -- or lose -- weight for a role? Click through the gallery above to find out. \n  \n George Clooney stunned his female fans when he put on 30 pounds for the 2005 flick Syriana. Meanwhile, Charlize Theron also gained 30 pounds to portray real-life serial killer Aileen Wuornos in 2003's Monster. Theron's dedication to the role won her the Academy Award for best actress. \n  \n Some stars have had to drastically shed the pounds for their dream roles. \n  \n Christian Bale lost 63 pounds for The Machinist. His daily diet consisted of only water, one cup of coffee and an apple. \n  \n Who else? Check out the gallery and then weigh in on the weigh in that surprised you the most! ||||| Matthew McConaughey committed to losing 30 pounds to play a man with HIV in \"The Dallas Buyer's Club,\" telling Larry King, \"I should not look healthy by the time I'm doing that film.\" \n  \n Anne Hathaway not only chopped off her brown locks to portray Fantine in \"Les Miserables,\" she lost a substantial amount of weight for the role. Though rumors ran rampant that she was starving herself, her rep claims she was \"on a special diet\" to \"look more frail as she is playing a prostitute who is dying of tuberculosis.\" \n  \n Mila Kunis dropped 20 pounds off her 5-foot-two-inch frame to play a ballerina in 2010's \"Black Swan.\" \"I could see why this industry is so f*cked up, because at 95 pounds, I would literally look at myself in the mirror and I was like, 'Oh my God!' she told E! News. \"I had no shape, no boobs, no ass .. All you saw was bone.\" Kunis continued: \"In real life, I looked disgusting, but in photographs and on film, it looked amazing.\" \n  \n Rooney Mara went through a total transformation for her role as Lisbeth Salander in \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\" Not only did she chop and dye her hair and get several piercings, she \"starved\" herself to lose weight for the role. \"[Director] David [Fincher] didn't want me to lose any weight; that was something that I wanted to do that he was, kind of, opposed to,\" she told The Hollywood Reporter. \n  \n Natalie Portman had to look near skeletal to play a crazy ballerina in \"Black Swan.\" Like Mila Kunis, she also dropped 20 pounds and scored the Academy Award for Best Actress in 2011. Portman trained in ballet for a full year before filming in order to portray the ballerina. \n  \n 50 Cent lost a shocking amount of weight for his role in \"Things Fall Apart,\" in which he plays a cancer-ridden football player. The actor and rapper said he dropped from 214 pounds to 160 pounds over the course of just nine weeks with a liquid diet and working out three hours a day. \n  \n Christian Bale has put his body through hell for movie roles. The action lost nearly 65 pounds by eating only 275 calories a day over the course of four months, for his role in \"The Machinist.\" The 121-pound actor then bulked up to 190 lbs in just five months to play Batman in \"Batman Begins\" and he later gained another 30 pounds of muscle for \"The Dark Knight.\" \n  \n Beyonce lost 20 pounds to play Deena Jones, the lead singer of the Dreamettes, in 2006's \"Dreamgirls.\" \"At the beginning (of filming), I was my normal weight,\"she told People. \"I actually gained a little bit, but then I lost 20 lbs. when I went from young Deena to old Deena. I wanted it to be something more than just make-up and hair. I wanted to see the change.\" \n  \n Tom Hanks has challenged his body to fit the role throughout the years. He gained 30 pounds in 1992 to play an alcoholic baseball coach in \"A League of Their Own,\" and lost all of it and more for the 1993 movie \"Philadelphia,\" where he played an AIDS patient. Years later he lost more than 50 pounds to portray a plane crash survivor in \"Cast Away.\" \n  \n Seth Rogen shed 30 pounds in 2009 for his title role in 2011's \"The Green Hornet\" by eating right and working out. \"No...I did not do any experimental injections! It's just diet and exercise. It works!\" he told the Long Island Press in 2011. \n  \n Former \"Lost\" star Matthew Fox made himself almost unrecognizable for his role as a cage-fighter in 2012's \"Alex Cross.\" \"The amount of dedication and the weight loss is this much of where he went,\" his co-star Tyler Perry told MTV. \"He really went to where ever he had to go. I don't even want to know what dark places he went to to get that character, but he was amazing.\" \n  \n Matt Damon lost a startling 50 pounds for 1996's \"Courage Under Fire,\" but it came at a price. According to ABC News, he lost 40 pounds in under three months for the role, and it left him with adrenal gland damage. \n  \n After having a baby, Jennifer Hudson had to drop her pregnancy weight quickly to portray Winnie Mandela in 2011's \"Winnie.\" \"Whatever it takes to morph into a character I'll do it,\" Hudson told People, adding that she dropped the pounds by working out and exercising portion control through Weight Watchers. |||||\nWhat is a shorter version of the above article?" }

An important aspect of Japanese society is making sure that everything is absolutely clean and that's the case in all sporting events and certainly also in football.\" \n  \n More on the World Cup from the BBC: \n  \n A habit built from childhood \n  \n Senegal fans have in fact been seen doing the same at this year's World Cup - but it's the Japanese who pioneered it and are now famous for it. \n  \n It is something that comes as a surprise to many foreigners attending matches in Japan. \n  \n \"They might leave a bottle or some kind of food package on the ground and then it's often the case that people get tapped on the shoulder by Japanese people indicating they should clean up or take it home but can't leave it there,\" Mr McIntyre says. \n  \n Image copyright AFP Image caption Japan fans certainly know how to celebrate \n  \n It's a habit drilled into Japanese people from early childhood. \n  \n \"Cleaning up after football matches is an extension of basic behaviours that are taught in school, where the children clean their school classrooms and hallways,\" explains Scott North, professor of sociology at Osaka University. \n  \n \"With constant reminders throughout childhood, these behaviours become habits for much of the population.\" \n  \n What do fans make of the fact their post-match cleaning spree becomes a regular hit on social media? If anything, they're proud. \n  \n \"In addition to their heightened consciousness of the need to be clean and to recycle, cleaning up at events like the World Cup is a way Japanese fans demonstrate pride in their way of life and share it with the rest of us,\" explains Prof North. \n  \n \"What better place to make a statement about the need to care responsibly for the planet than the World Cup?\" he adds. \n  \n It doesn't mean that there is any more or less passion, insists Mr McIntyre. It's simply that passion doesn't slip into neglect of basic rules of behaviour let alone violence. \n  \n \"I know it may sound bland and boring, but this is the reality of a country that's built on respect and politeness,\" he laughs. \n  \n \"And this simply extends to doing respectful things in football.\" \n  \n \"I think it's a wonderful thing that the World Cup brings so many nations and people together and get to learn and exchange these kinds of things. That's the beauty of football.\" ||||| Rating is available when the video has been rented. \n  \n This feature is not available right now. Please try again later. ||||| Forget banners. Many Japanese fans were waving bright blue garbage bags at the group stage finale against Colombia. \n  \n The Japanese have touched spectators around the world by cleaning up their trash after every match at the World Cup. After their 0-0 draw against Greece last week, fans of the Blue Samurai shrugged off disappointment and cleaned up after themselves inside the stadium following the final whistle. It's a class act that has its roots in Japan's values of being respectful of hosts and protecting the environment. \n  \n Japan's 1-4 loss to Colombia on Tuesday eliminated the team from the World Cup. \n  \n A Japan fan helps collect litter from the stadium after the Japan and Colombia match on Tuesday.
